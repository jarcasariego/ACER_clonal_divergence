## Abstract
Phenotypic plasticity is defined as a property of individual genotypes to produce different
phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions. This ability may be expressed
at behavioral, biochemical, physiological, and/or developmental levels, exerting direct influence
over species' demographic performance. In reef-building corals, a group critically threatened by
global change in the Anthropocene, non-genetic mechanisms (i.e., epigenetic and microbiome
variation) have been shown to participate in plastic physiological responses to environmental
change. Yet, the precise way in which these mechanisms interact, contribute to such responses,
and their adaptive potential is still obscure. The present work aims to fill this gap by using a
multi-omics approach targeting the complexity and interconnection among the components
modulating phenotypic plasticity in staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) clones subject to
different depth conditions. Results show conspicuous variation in lipidome, epigenome and
transcriptome, but not in symbiotic and microbial communities. In addition, a potential shift
towards a more heterotrophic feeding behavior was found in corals at higher depth. These
observations are consistent with a multi-mechanism modulation of rapid acclimation in corals,
underscoring the complexity of this process and the importance of a multifactorial approach to
inform potential intervention to enhance coral adaptive capacity.
